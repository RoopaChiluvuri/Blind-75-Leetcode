You are given the standard mapping from English letters to digits on a phone keypad:

map = {
2 -> abc
3 -> def
4	-> ghi
5	-> jkl
6	 -> mno
7	-> pqrs
8	-> tuv
9	-> wxyz
}

Write a program that outputs all the words from a given list of KNOWN_WORDS 
that can be formed from a given n-digit phone number, according to the keypad mapping above.

KNOWN_WORDS = ['careers', 'linkedin', 'linkedgo', 'hiring', 'interview']

phone_number = 2273377
# Output: ['careers']

phone_number = 54653346
# Output: ['linkedin', 'linkedgo']
